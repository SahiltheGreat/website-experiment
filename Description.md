Create new branch: git checkout -b BranchName See all the branches on
your local repo: git branch switch between branches: git checkout
BranchName

Why we use branche:

    Reason for using branches is that, so that the master branch remains clean

    So, all the changes you make, are done in the newbranch which you created. The benefit of this is that, if you make a change which messes up the old work, you can easily get the "last-working code" from the master branch.


    Another reason is that, when you don't have access to edit the master branch, i.e. you are not the owner of the repo. Then, tum directly master ko edit kr bhi nhi skte.
    To tumhe nyi branch bnake, pull request create krna hi pdega.
